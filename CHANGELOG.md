### Technical Details

#### Agent Initialization 

## Implementation Details

### Agent Communication Protocol
1. Task Initialization
   - Initial handshake between coordinator and worker agents
   - Role assignment and verification
   - Build zone allocation
   - Inventory distribution

2. Build Coordination
   - Real-time position synchronization
   - Material request handling
   - Progress updates
   - Zone transition management

3. Error Handling
   - Disconnection recovery
   - Build collision resolution
   - Inventory desynchronization fixes
   - Zone access conflicts

### Performance Considerations
1. Network Optimization
   - Batched updates for position data
   - Compressed blueprint transmission
   - Selective state synchronization
   - Priority-based message queuing

2. Resource Management
   - Dynamic inventory allocation
   - Memory usage optimization
   - CPU load balancing
   - Connection pooling

### Known Limitations
- Maximum of 8 concurrent builders per zone
- Blueprint size limited to 64x64x64 blocks
- Requires minimum 2 agents for collaboration
- Network latency sensitivity above 200ms

### Future Improvements
- Dynamic role reassignment
- Advanced error recovery
- Expanded blueprint size support
- Enhanced progress visualization
